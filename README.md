# Project-4--Hydrophone-Assignment

#  Introduction
The purpose of the project is to analyze raw Hydrophone data for Oregon Shelf and Oregon Offshore Cables Bonthic Experiement Package. From here, power spectral density (PSD) will be graphed and Spectogram . PSD is the measure of signal's power content vs frequency. This will then give us information on how Ocean


 #   Questions:
 Plots of the PSD(db) vs frequency. Oregon Shelf on the left and Oregon Offshore On the right Column.

•What is the effect of wind (1point)and rain (1point)on underwater noise? Explain any behavior you observe in your result.
THe effect of wind and rain has some effect on underwater noise. Obviously if rain drops then some noise should be created due to impact, on the other hand, being windy will encourage movements of waves. According from our "No Rain and No wind (oregon Shell)" the overall data stays around 40 PSDdb while the graph with the rainy and windy shows that its stabilizes at 50 PSDdb. Although there could be some error, on the No rain and now wind data since the exact data this event occur didn't have any hydrophone data recorded, we can see the correct result of what it should be. Rainy and Windy should create some noise.

For the Offshore data, which is further from away from the shore, we can a similar result that when there is rain and wind average Power spectral desnity is higher.  for No rain and No wind, the graph started at 75PSD db and stays at around 50 while when its raindy and windy the graph starts at 80PSD db and stays at around 55 while frequency gets higher. However, As to mention before, we should be able to a greater difference if the exact date of raw hydrophone data was available at that time.

•Which one has the highestimpact? Rain or wind?(1point)
The highest Imapct according from the data is Rainy. Looking at the Oregon shelf data. when it was windy the average PSD is at 50 while when its 60 PSDdb when it is Rainy. On the other hand, looking from the Oregon Offshore, the it starts of at 60PSD db and stays at 30 when windy while it starts at 75PSDdb and stays at around 50 for the Rainy weather. 
 This makes sense since rain is heavier and should create more impact on the water. When it is windy, the normal tendecy is to create waves but mostly in a calm way.
 
•What arethe main reasonsforobservingdifferentspectral levels in Oregon shelf compared to Oregon offshore? (1point)
The main reason for observing different spectral for Oregon shelf and Oregon Offshore is to see how depth will affect the transfer of sound. When it rain and windy for oregon shel the data starts of at 75 and stay at 50PSDdb and 70 for Oregon Offshore and stayss at around 40 as frequency increases.
 Oregon Shelf has higher Power spectral density because thats when the ocean is shallower. Meaning, there is a chance that the sound can travel all the way down to the bottom and create reflection and boucing back after hitting the bottom. On the other hand, a deeper area of the sea wouldn't have as much reflection since most of the sound will be absord by the water and also some organisms.

Airgun are pressurized blast of air into through the ocean into the seafloor and produces bubbles. This are done by the companies who are trying to look for oil and gas. Our data have recorded of about 0-5000Hz frequency on 2019-08-01. Comparing to Wenz curve, it says that bubble are normally in the range of 100Hz up to around 20000Hz. This illustrates that the frequecy of the data fits well for Bubbles making sound that was detected by the Hydrophone.

From the data we can see a strip showing there is a frequency from 1000-5000Hz over a period of time. From the wenz curve, we know that Biologics/ animals creates sound from 10-100,000Hz of sound. Again, this fits as a Marine Mammal making a sound under water. This is most likely a sound coming from a whale communitcating at great distances.

The aim for the graph was trying to capture the axial seamount volcano explosion that happen on april of 2015. However, since there were no data recorded on april, I have decidede to look into september instead. Fortunately, there were still some activities happening after a few as can be seen from the data. Most of the data are at 0-20frequency.Comparing this values to Wenz curve, we have confrimed that this can considered as an explosion which is most likely due tot the volcano exploding underwater. 

Compare the bandwidth of these three signals(1point). Are they consistent with what is shown in the Wenz curve(refer to the Ocean Noise slides)?(2point)
As Have been mentioned below each images, those frequency of the Airgun, Marine Mammals and Volcano NOise seems to math to that of the Wenz curve.

# Conclusion:
 This project can be considered as a success on studying about ocean noises. Initially it was studied the effect of rain and wind on Ocean noises. It was found that rain and wind affects it but more greatly when it is raining. Next, graphs of Airgun, Marine mammals, an Volcano frequency are compared to Wenz curve and seems to match thos that we have expected. From this project, we can see that Ocean noises can come from different things from nature. However, adding more noises to the ocean by having more loud ships on the ocean or different testing would definitely change the environment of those animals that have only been used to the natural noises.
