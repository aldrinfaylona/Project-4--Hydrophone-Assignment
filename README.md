# Project-4--Hydrophone-Assignment

#Introduction
The purpose of the project is to analyze raw Hydrophone data for Oregon Shelf and Oregon Offshore Cables Bonthic Experiement Package. From here, power spectral density (PSD) will be graphed and Spectogram . PSD is the measure of signal's power content vs frequency. This will then give us information on how Ocean


 #   Questions:

•What is the effect of wind (1point)and rain (1point)on underwater noise? Explain any behavior you observe in your result.
